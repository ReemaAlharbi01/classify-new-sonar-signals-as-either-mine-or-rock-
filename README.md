Using Sonar dataset to classify new sonar signals as either "mine" or "rock"

The Sonar dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, used for binary classification tasks. It consists of sonar signals that were bounced off different objects in the water. The goal is to predict whether the object is a "mine" or a "rock" based on the sonar signal characteristics.
